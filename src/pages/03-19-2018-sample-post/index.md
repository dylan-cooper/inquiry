Oooooh-weeee, my first blog post!

I’m a frontend developer specializing in all things JavaScript. Throughout my career, I’ve done a fair bit of everything: Angular, React, jQuery, you name it. Of course, I’ve also done a fair bit of everything in CSS land, whether it’s vanilla CSS, LESS, SASS, CSS Modules, and (of course) the gamut of CSS in JS solutions. I’m from little ol’ Omaha, Nebraska, which I think most people looks a bit like this.
